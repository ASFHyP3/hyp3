# Compute Environments that are shared between multiple jobs and/or steps should be defined here, 
# rather than in the job spec. The format is the same, except the name becomes the key:

# ExampleComputeEnvName:
#   instance_types: ...
#   ami_id: ...
#   allocation_type: ...
#   allocation_strategy: ...

# Once the environment is defined here, it can be imported in the job spec step
# by using the `import` key:

# JOB_NAME:
#   ...
#   steps:
#     step_name:
#       ...
#       compute_environment:
#         import: 'ExampleComputeEnvName'

# Note that the name must be unique, i.e. a compute environment that is defined in a job spec using
# the `name` key cannot also be defined here, unless it is not imported in the same deployment (envs here
# are only rendered if they are imported). Also note that the name should be in pascal case to avoid
# cfn-lint errors.

compute_environments:
  # Default is defined per-deployment in the deployment actions.
