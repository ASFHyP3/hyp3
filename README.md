## Developer Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:ASFHyP3/hyp3.git
   cd hyp3
   ```
2. Create and activate a conda environment
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate hyp3
   ```
3. Run the tests
   ```
   make tests
   ```

## Deployment

The deployment steps below describe how to deploy to a general AWS account you own/administer.
HyP3 does support deploying to more secure environments which may require additional steps and are
described in [`docs/deployments`](docs/deployments).

### Prerequisites
These resources are required for a successful deployment, but managed separately:

- HyP3 plugin container images and tags. Current plugins are defined in [`job_spec`](./job_spec).
- S3 bucket for CloudFormation deployment artifacts
- EarthData Login account authorized to download data from ASF
- IAM role configured for [REST API access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-logging.html#set-up-access-logging-permissions)
- default VPC
- IAM user and roles for automated CloudFormation deployments (if desired)
- AWS Secrets Manager Secret containing key-value pairs for all secrets listed in the deployed [`job_spec`s](./job_spec)
- For Earthdata Cloud deployments:
  - An IAM permissions boundary policy ARN
- For non-Earthdata Cloud deployments:
  - DNS record for custom API domain name
  - SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager for custom API domain name

### Stack Parameters
Review the parameters in [cloudformation.yml](apps/main-cf.yml) for deploy time configuration options.

### Deploy with CloudFormation

To deploy HyP3 with reasonable defaults, follow the steps below. For more advanced
deployment configuration, see the [deployment GitHub Action](.github/actions/deploy-hyp3/action.yml).

From the repository root, 

- Install dependencies for build and run
```sh
make install
```

- Install Python dependencies for AWS Lambda functions (requires pip for python 3.9)
```sh
make build
```

- Package the CloudFormation template
```sh
aws cloudformation package \
            --template-file apps/main-cf.yml \
            --s3-bucket <CloudFormation artifact bucket> \
            --output-template-file packaged.yml
```

- Deploy to AWS with CloudFormation
```sh
aws cloudformation deploy \
            --stack-name <name of your HyP3 Stack> \
            --template-file packaged.yml \
            --role-arn <arn for your deployment user/role> \
            --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
            --parameter-overrides \
                "VpcId=<default vpc>" \
                "SubnetIds=<comma separated list of subnet ids>" \
                "EDLUsername=<EDL Username to download products>" \
                "EDLPassword=<EDL Password to download products>" \
                "DomainName=<Domain Name>" \
                "CertificateArn=<arn for ssl certificate>"
```
- Check API at `https://<Domain Name>/ui`

- (Optional) clean render and build artifacts
```sh
make clean
```
*Note: this will remove any [untracked files](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-files#Documentation/git-ls-files.txt--o)
in the `apps/` or `lib/dynamo/` directory.*

## Running the API Locally

The API can be run locally to verify changes, but must be connected to a set of existing DynamoDB tables.

1. Set up AWS credentials in your environment as described
   [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#configuration).
   Also see our [wiki page](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/.github-private/wiki/AWS-Access#aws-access-keys).
2. Edit `tests/cfg.env` to specify the names of existing DynamoDB tables from a particular HyP3 deployment.
   Delete all of the `AWS_*` variables.
3. Run the API (replace `<profile>` with the AWS config profile that corresponds to the HyP3 deployment):
   ```sh
   AWS_PROFILE=<profile> make run
   ```
4. You should see something like `Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080` in the output. Open the host URL in your browser.
   You should see the Swagger UI for the locally running API.
5. In Chrome or Chromium, from the Swagger UI tab, open Developer tools, select the Application tab, then select
   the host URL under Cookies. In Firefox, open Web Developer Tools, select the Storage tab, then select
   the host URL under Cookies. Add a new cookie with the following Name:
   ```
   asf-urs
   ```
   And the following Value:
   ```
   eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1cnMtdXNlci1pZCI6InVzZXIiLCJleHAiOjIxNTk1Mzc0OTYyLCJ1cnMtZ3JvdXBzIjpbeyJuYW1lIjoiYXV0aC1ncm91cCIsImFwcF91aWQiOiJhdXRoLXVpZCJ9XX0.hMtgDTqS5wxDPCzK9MlXB-3j6MAcGYeSZjGf4SYvq9Y
   ```
   And `/` for Path.
6. To verify access, query the `GET /user` endpoint and verify that the response includes `"user_id": "user"`.
