    costs_response:
      type: object
      description: >
        Dictionary whose keys are the job types available in this deployment.
        Each value is a fixed or variable cost definition.
        A fixed cost definition has a single cost key whose value is the credit cost of the job type.
        A variable cost definition has a cost_parameters key whose value is a list of job parameters,
        and a cost_table key whose value is a dictionary that allows looking up credit cost based on the job parameters listed in cost_parameters.
        The example response structure shows JOB_TYPE_A with a fixed cost definition,
        JOB_TYPE_B with a variable cost definition with one cost parameter,
        and JOB_TYPE_C with a variable cost definition with two cost parameters.
        For example, a JOB_TYPE_C job with job parameters {"foo": "foo_value1", "bar": "bar_value2"} would have a credit cost of 5.
      example:
        JOB_TYPE_A:
          cost: 1.0
        JOB_TYPE_B:
          cost_parameters: [foo]
          cost_table:
            foo_value1: 1.0
            foo_value2: 5.0
        JOB_TYPE_C:
          cost_parameters: [foo, bar]
          cost_table:
            foo_value1:
              bar_value1: 1.0
              bar_value2: 5.0
            foo_value2:
              bar_value1: 2.0
