# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.8.4](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3/compare/v2.8.3...v2.8.4)
### Security
- Encrypt Earthdata username and password using AWS Secrets Manager.
### Added
- Documentation about deploying to a JPL-managed commercial AWS account has been added to
  [`docs/deployments`](docs/deployments).

## [2.8.3](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3/compare/v2.8.2...v2.8.3)
### Changed
- Increase monthly job quota per user from 250 to 1,000.

## [2.8.2](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3/compare/v2.8.1...v2.8.2)
### Fixed
- Limited the number of jobs a subscription can send at a time to avoid timing out. Fixes [#794](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3/issues/794).
- Confirm there are no unprocessed granules before disabling subscriptions past their expiration date.

## [2.8.1](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3/compare/v2.8.0...v2.8.1)
### Changed
- Jobs are now assigned a `priority` attribute when submitted. `priority` is calculated based on jobs already
  submitted month-to-date by the same user. Jobs with a higher `priority` value will run before jobs with a lower value.
- `Batch.ServerException` errors encountered by the Step Function are now retried, to address intermittent errors when
  the Step Functions service calls the Batch SubmitJob API.

## [2.8.0](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3/compare/v2.7.7...v2.8.0)
### Added
- HyP3 can now be deployed into a JPL managed commercial AWS account
- Selectable security environment when rendering CloudFormation templates, which will modify resources/configurations for:
  - `ASF` (default) -- AWS accounts managed by the Alaska Satellite Facility
  - `EDC` -- AWS accounts managed by the NASA Earthdata CLoud
  - `JPL` -- AWS accounts managed by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
- A `security_environment` Make variable used by the `render` target (and any target that depends on `render`). 
  Use like `make security_environment=ASF build`

### Changed

### Removed
- The `EarthdataCloud` CloudFormation template parameter to `apps/main-cf.yml`
